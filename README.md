# The Scalar Waze - 4D Theory of Everything

## What’s This All About?

Imagine a universe where quantum fields dance with gravity, time loops twist reality, and a mysterious "nugget" field holds it all together. Welcome to **The Scalar Waze**—a daring 4D simulation that dares to unify everything: quantum mechanics, general relativity, and beyond. Built from scratch in Python, this project weaves together a tetrahedral spin network, closed timelike curves (CTCs), and a wild mix of particles and forces. It’s not just code—it’s a cosmic playground.

- **Why It’s Cool**: Simulates a Theory of Everything (TOE) with a $5^4$ spacetime grid, spitting out entanglement, curvature, and even audio signals from a "flux capacitor."
- **Who’s Behind It**: Travis Jones, with a little help from xAI’s Grok 3.
- **Where It Lives**: Right here, ready for you to explore.

Dive into the code, read the paper, and twist the fabric of reality yourself!
